    <div class="div1">After a long day of work, Kanye West goes to his Kanye Nest to take his Kanye Rest. 
                      He wakes up feeling his Kanye Best. Then he’ll get Kanye Dressed on his Kanye Vest to go on a Kanye Quest.
                      He goes to church and becomes Kanye Blessed, then to a hotel room to be a Kanye Guest. 
                      Then to school to take his Kanye Test. He forgot to brush his teeth. 
                      Did he run out of Kanye Crest? His neighbor stole it, what a Kanye Pest. 
                      He then puts on some axe for some Kanye zest and goes to the bar puffing out his Kanye chest. 
                      Gets drunk into a Kanye mess and goes home to the the Kanye West part of town. 
                      He realized his life was a wreck, and was feeling a little Kanye depressed. 
                      “My life sucks he Kanye digressed. He decided to get some Italian to he flew to Kanye Trieste. 
                      He got some pasta and started to Kanye digest. You should get some Kanye rest his wife Kanye pressed. 
                      Instead he went to a Kanye fest. He then realized he needed to go to Dallas for his competition, 
                      so he went to the airport and hopped on Kanye southwest, got some Kanye rest, 
                      and the next morning was feeling ready for his Kanye contest. Or at least he Kanye guessed. 
                      On the day of the competition he was feeling a little Kanye stressed. 
                      But in the end the judges were Kanye impressed. For his performance he was awarded with the Kanye chest, 
                      clearly identified with the Kanye crest. There ends the story of Kanye West.

                      Now, lets say, hypothetically, that somebody once told me that the world would proceed to roll me, and made the claim that I was not, 
                      the smartest tool in the shed. Which would lead us to look at the facts and see that she was looking kind of dumb, 
                      due to the fact that she had placed her finger and her thumb, in the shape of the letter L, located on her forehead.
                      This would mean that the years would start coming, and logically wont stop coming, that I was, hypothetically, fed to the rules, 
                      which would proceed with me hitting the ground running. Which didn’t make sense, to live for fun, in a way that your brain gets smart, yet your head gets dumb, 
                      seeing as there’s so much to do, and so much to see, so now I must pose the question, what is wrong with taking the backseat? 
                      This is due to the fact that you’ll never know if you don’t go, nor you will shine if you don’t glow.
                      For you see, you are, at this moment, an All-Star, so get your game on, and proceed to go play, indeed, 
                      you’re an All-Star, get the show on, which would entitled you to get paid. That would mean that all that glitters, 
                      is indeed gold, and that only shooting stars, can participate in the process of breaking the mold.
